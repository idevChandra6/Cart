#CarouselControl
CarouselControl is built on top of iCarousel as a dynamic library and provides a simple way to create rotary carousel views with fade in/out effect.

#How to integrate into a project:
1. Drag and drop CarouselControl.framework into the project.
2. Include CarouselControl.framework into the project targetâ€™s embedded binaries.
3. Import CarouselControl into the Swift file that acts as a datasource for the carousel.

#How to use it:
1. In your storyboard, subclass a new ViewController as CarouselViewController and set CarouselControl as its module.

3. Conform to CarouselViewControllerDelegate protocol to get call backs when user swipes to a new card or taps Select on the a card.
